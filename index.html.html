        <h2>What is Cyber Security?</h2>
        <img src="C:\Users\nikhi\OneDrive\Desktop\n.jpeg" alt="Cyber Security Concept">
        <p>Cyber security is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks aim to access, change, or destroy sensitive information, extort money, or disrupt normal business processes. Cybersecurity includes various disciplines such as network security, application security, information security, and cloud security.</p>
        
        <h2>Importance of Cyber Security</h2>
        <img src="C:\Users\nikhi\OneDrive\Desktop\i.jpg" alt="Data Protection">
        <p>With an increasing number of devices connected to the internet, the risk of cyber threats continues to grow. Organizations and individuals must take preventive measures to protect sensitive data. Cybersecurity is essential to prevent identity theft, financial fraud, data breaches, and cyber espionage.</p>
        

 	<h2>Government Cyber Crime Portal</h2>
        <p>The government has set up cybercrime portals to help citizens report and address cyber-related crimes. These platforms allow individuals to report cases of cyber fraud, online harassment, financial scams, and other digital threats. If you encounter any cybercrime, you can report it through the official government cybercrime portal.</p>
        <p><strong>Visit:</strong> <a href="https://cybercrime.gov.in/" target="_blank" style="color: #5bc0be;">National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal</a></p>
        
        <h2>Best Practices</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Use strong and unique passwords:</strong> Ensure each password is complex and different for every account. Consider using a password manager.</li>
            <li><strong>Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):</strong> Adds an extra layer of security by requiring an additional verification step.</li>
            <li><strong>Keep software and operating systems updated:</strong> Outdated software often contains vulnerabilities that hackers exploit.</li>
            <li><strong>Be cautious of phishing emails and suspicious links:</strong> Cybercriminals use fake emails to steal sensitive information. Always verify sender identities.</li>
            <li><strong>Use antivirus and firewall protection:</strong> Install reputable security software and keep it updated.</li>
            <li><strong>Backup your data regularly:</strong> Store copies of important files in secure, offline locations to prevent ransomware attacks.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid using public Wi-Fi for sensitive transactions:</strong> Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to encrypt your internet connection.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Types of Cyber Threats</h2>
        <img src="C:\Users\nikhi\OneDrive\Desktop\Types-of-Cyber-Security-Threats.jpg" alt="Types of Cyber Threats Diagram">
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Malware:</strong> Malicious software like viruses, worms, trojans, and spyware that can damage or steal data.</li>
            <li><strong>Ransomware:</strong> Encrypts files and demands payment for decryption, often causing severe financial damage.</li>
            <li><strong>Phishing:</strong> Fake emails or messages pretending to be from trusted sources to steal personal information.</li>
            <li><strong>Social Engineering Attacks:</strong> Hackers manipulate people into revealing confidential data through deception.</li>
            <li><strong>Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks:</strong> Cybercriminals overwhelm a network or website with excessive traffic, causing it to crash.</li>
            <li><strong>Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:</strong> Hackers intercept communication between two parties to steal data or insert malicious content.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Use of AI in Cyber Security</h2>
        <img src="C:\Users\nikhi\OneDrive\Desktop\ai.webp" alt="AI in Cyber Security">
        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays a crucial role in modern cybersecurity by enhancing threat detection, response, and prevention. AI-driven security solutions analyze vast amounts of data to identify patterns and anomalies that indicate potential cyber threats.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Threat Detection:</strong> AI can detect malware, phishing attacks, and network intrusions in real-time.</li>
            <li><strong>Automated Response:</strong> AI-powered security systems can instantly respond to cyber threats, minimizing damage.</li>
            <li><strong>Behavior Analysis:</strong> AI monitors user behavior to detect unusual activities that may indicate security breaches.</li>
            <li><strong>Fraud Prevention:</strong> AI helps prevent financial fraud by identifying suspicious transactions and unauthorized access.</li>
            <li><strong>Cybersecurity Automation:</strong> Reduces human workload by automating routine security tasks and improving efficiency.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Cybersecurity Myths</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Myth: Strong passwords alone are enough.</strong> Reality: Multi-factor authentication and regular updates are also crucial.</li>
            <li><strong>Myth: Only large organizations are targeted.</strong> Reality: Small businesses and individuals are also common targets.</li>
            <li><strong>Myth: Antivirus software alone keeps you safe.</strong> Reality: A layered security approach is needed.</li>
            <li><strong>Myth: Public Wi-Fi is safe with a password.</strong> Reality: Public Wi-Fi can be easily hacked; use a VPN.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Key Cybersecurity Best Practices & Technologies</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> Protects sensitive data from unauthorized access.</li>
            <li><strong>Endpoint Security:</strong> Secures devices like laptops and smartphones against cyber threats.</li>
            <li><strong>Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):</strong> Provides real-time threat monitoring and analysis.</li>
            <li><strong>Zero Trust Security:</strong> Assumes no user or device is trustworthy by default.</li>
            <li><strong>Cloud Security:</strong> Protects cloud-based data and applications.</li>
        </ul>
